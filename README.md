# Hot Seat

### TODO:

- historical logos for older seasons
- hide bar chart on graphs
- shorten "heat index" to just "heat" when on small screen (likewise, use short name)
- enable bar charts to be other features (like SRS, change in W-L %)
- centering team abbrevs, and adding ... on end to indicate more (without cutting off any partially)
  - maybe it swings back in gallery like fashion

### Deployment

Deployed to Netlify using Astro Supabase starter

The Astro Supabase starter demonstrates how to integrate **Supabase** into an Astro project deployed on Netlify.
